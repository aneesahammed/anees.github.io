      <description>I was not a regular coffee☕️ person before coming here in Ireland. The plausible cause could be because I come from Dubai 🏙. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a good 8 years of my life there. Gradually I started blending into the coffee☕️ culture of Ireland. Morning coffee from a nearby coffee-shop, another one at the office before getting into the routine agile sprint, it was much needed to keep me awake👀 ;) and last but not the least one at seven-wonders while walking back to the apartment.</description>
