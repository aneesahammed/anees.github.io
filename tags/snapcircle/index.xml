      <description>I was not a regular coffee☕️ person before coming here in Ireland. The plausible cause could be that I have spent a good 8 years of my life in Dubai🏙. Gradually I started blending into the coffee☕️ culture of Ireland - a morning coffee from nearby coffee-shop, another one at the office before getting into the routine agile sprint, it was much needed to keep me awake👀 ;). Last but not least a coffee from seven-wonders while walking back to my apartment.</description>
