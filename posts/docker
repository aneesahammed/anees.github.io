 When people say **Docker** they typically means Docker Engine.

## Docker Engine
Docker Engine is the client-server application with docker-daemon being the server accepting command from docker-client.

![image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/images/architecture.svg)

Docker Engine is made of docker-daemon, REST API that defines interfaces for interacting with docker-daemon & CLI client that talks to docker-daemon through the REST API wrapper.

## Docker Machine

Docker Machine is a tool for provisioning and managing hosts running "Docker Engine" on them.

You can use Docker Machine to install "Docker Engine" on local virtual system ex: VirtualBox on Mac/Windows or remote virtual system ex: Cloud providers

## Docker for Windows/Mac
Since docker is a technology built around linux containers, for non Linux platforms we need to use some forms of virtualization to run docker.

Docker for Windows/Mac run as a **native** Windows/Mac app and manages a Linux VM internally.

If you're using windows, your Windows version should be 10 or newer

If you're using Mac then you need OSX 10.3 or newer

If you are using older versions of Windows or Mac, they you should [install Docker Toolbox (legacy)](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/).
